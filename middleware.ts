  // Lemon Squeezy signs the exact bytes of the request body. Clerk's
  // middleware, applied to a request it does not recognise as coming from a
  // signed-in browser, re-reads the body on its way through — and the body that
  // reaches the route is no longer byte-for-byte what the provider signed. The
  // handler then hashes something the sender never hashed and every delivery
  // verifies as forged, which is what happened: real payments were taken and
  // rejected as invalid signatures.
  //
  // The route authenticates with the provider's HMAC instead of a session, so
  // there is nothing for the middleware to do there.
  //
  // A single pattern, not two: this is Clerk's own page pattern with the
  // webhook added to the exclusion list, and it already covers /api and /trpc
  // because those paths do not look like static files. Next.js refuses to parse
  // a second pattern that opens with a lookahead over a literal group.
